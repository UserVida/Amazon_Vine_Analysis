# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this project was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program to determine if there was a bias towards favourable reviews from Vine memberships in the dataset. Amazon Vine Program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. A single dataset from Amazon reviews was chosen and extracted so analysis could be completed using PySparks.

The percentage of Vine reviews that were 5 stars was 0 while the percentage of non-Vine reviews that were 5 stars was 60.15 %. 

## Summary 

In this dataset, there were no Vine memberships. Therefore, no analysis into potential bias could be performed. Interestingly, the majority of reviews from non-paid, non-vine reviews were positive (60%). Another analysis on a dataset with Vine memberships would be necessary in order to test for bias. Additionally performing a statistical test would be helpful to determine whether there is an actual statistical difference based on sample size.
